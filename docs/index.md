[BinaryMuseGAN](https://salu133445.github.io/bmusegan/) is a follow-up project
of the [MuseGAN](https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/) project.

In this project, we first investigate how the real-valued piano-rolls generated
by the generator may lead to difficulties in training the discriminator for
CNN-based models. To overcome the binarization issue, we propose to append to
the generator an additional refiner network, which try to refine the real-valued
predictions generated by the pretrained generator to binary-valued ones. The
proposed model is able to directly generate binary-valued piano-rolls at test
time.

It's an open source project on
[Github](https://github.com/salu133445/bmusegan/).
You can play with it if you're interested.
