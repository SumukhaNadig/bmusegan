[BinaryMuseGAN](https://salu133445.github.io/bmusegan/) is a follow-up project
of the [MuseGAN](https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/) project.

In this project, we first investigate how the real-valued pianorolls generated
by the generator may lead to difficulties in training the discriminator for
CNN-based models. To overcome the binarization issue, we propose to append to
the generator an additional refiner network, which is trained to refine the
real-valued predictions generated by the pretrained generator to binary-valued
ones. The proposed model is able to directly generate binary-valued pianorolls
at test time.
